# Advent of Code Display
The idea of this project is to cement my knowledge about creating web applications with Erlang, as well as, integrating the solutions of answers of the Advent of Code.

First, I want to use my past solutions in to the app as well as to share the Advent of Code tree into my page. The solutions should be executable in the applications with my inputs. Last year's (2022) solutions are on Erlang.

Second, I want this app to consume my answers to this year's AOC (2023) via restful application. This year (2023), I will use Elixir as my language.

Third, I want to add extensibility to the web app in order to add future solutions to the AOC future challenges in other languages.
